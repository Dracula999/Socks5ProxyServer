Hello. This is a diary for development Socks5 Proxy Server by the person who is a beginner ins Golang.

I will tell my experience of learning the language and share notes on the challenges that I've encountered during the implementation of this project and 

:)


First of all, I'm on ubuntu 18.04. I've installed go following this guide: https://medium.com/better-programming/install-go-1-11-on-ubuntu-18-04-16-04-lts-8c098c503c5f
For the editer I'm using Visual Studio.

I've decided to implement other simpler projects that are related 
to this project (echoserver, chatserverclient - available in my github repos).
Those helped me to get to know "net" package. So now. Let's start implementing.
