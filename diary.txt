Hello. This is a diary for development Socks5 Proxy Server by the person who is a beginner ins Golang.

I will tell my experience of learning the language and share notes on the challenges that I've encountered during the implementation of this project and 

:)


First of all, I'm on ubuntu 18.04. I've installed go following this guide: https://medium.com/better-programming/install-go-1-11-on-ubuntu-18-04-16-04-lts-8c098c503c5f
For the editer I'm using Visual Studio.

I've decided to implement other simpler projects that are related 
to this project (echoserver, chatserverclient - available in my github repos).
Those helped me to get to know "net" package. So now. Let's start implementing.
https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1928.txt - This is an official documentation of
protocol.

Progressing slowly, because of lack of knowledge of networking specs. Also parsing bytes is kinda hard. The code is messy.
Implementing one case with auth (usr/pass), and only connect type. Figuring out what is bnd addr and bnd port took some time.
Currently, stuck at parsing port as string to 2 bytes representation. Also, creating and exchange loop between client and remote seems to be complicated.
